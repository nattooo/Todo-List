# To-Do List - HTML CSS Javascript

This is a simple To-Do List application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, view, and delete to-do items. To-do items are stored locally in the browser's localStorage, allowing users to persist their to-do list across sessions.

## Features

- Add new to-do items with a title and due date.
- View existing to-do items with their titles and due dates.
- Delete to-do items when they are completed or no longer needed.
- Automatic data persistence using localStorage.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use the input fields to enter the title and due date of the new to-do item.
4. Click the "Add Todo" button to add the to-do item to the list.
5. To delete a to-do item, click the "Delete" button next to the item.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the To-Do List application.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for adding, viewing, and deleting to-do items.
